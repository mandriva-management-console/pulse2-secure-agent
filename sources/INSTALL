1. Description
   ------------

This service comes from Cygwin's OpenSSH version 6.3p1-1. It can deploy
on a Microsoft Windows 32/64bits plateform :
   * an OpenSSH service,
   * A minimum GNU/Linux-like environment (command line and main tools).


2. Prerequisites
   -------------

At the time of drafting this document, supported platforms are as
follows :
  - MS Windows 2000 Professional SP4,
  - MS Windows XP Professional SP2 and SP3,
  - MS Windows 2003 Server SP2,
  - MS Windows Vista Ultimate SP2,
  - MS Windows 2008 Server SP1,
  - MS Windows 7 Ultimate.

This version is the replacement of older versions of the OpenSSH Agent :
  - In its "Linbox" flavour : openssh-4.6p1-1linbox5 and lower
  - In its "Mandriva" flavour : pulse2-secure-agent-2.0.0.exe and
  lower.


3. News of this agent
   ------------------

3.1. New series 1.0.x
     ----------------

The 1.0.x series is a complete evolution of the former Linbox agent :
  - Some graphical improvement in the installer,
  - New logical partitioning of the various components of the SSH
    service,
  - Cygwin1.dll now uses its own memory space and its own registry key;
    thus the agent does not come into conflict with any applications
    installed on the client and based on Cygwin,
  - Included some additional tools (wget, rsync etc. ...).


3.1. New series 1.1.x
     ----------------

The main evolution of the 1.1.x series is the ability to perform
smarter updates, thanks to a complete rewrite of the installer.


3.2. New series 1.2.x
     ----------------

Most of the service creation code has been reworked to bring Windows
Vista (and its derivatives like 2008 Server) compatibility.
This release also comes with all Cygwin binaries updated.


3.3. New 1.2.3
     ---------

A new tool named pulse2-ether-list.exe is used to get network
interfaces parameters on Windows.

A new flag has been introduced : "/FORCE" (see below).


3.4. New series 2.x
     --------------

This new release is based upon Cygwin's 1.7 major release.
It brings full support for Microsoft Windows Vista, 2008 Server and Seven.
It also comes with all Cygwin binaries updated.

If upgrading from 1.x to 2.x, please REBOOT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

4. Installation Procedure
   ----------------------

4.1. Remove the previous agent (if applicable)
     -----------------------------------------

If a "Linbox" SSH Agent version is installed on the target client
("Mandriva" Secure Agent are NOT concerned), it is imperative to delete
it beforehand. To do this :
  - Make sure you stop the OpenSSH service (Control Panel,
    Server Administration, Services, "CygWin sshd"),
  - Remove the agent (Control Panel, Add / Remove programs, "OpenSSH for
    Windows (remove only)"),
  - Check that the directory content with the agent (default :
    C:\Program Files\OpenSSH) has been deleted.


4.2. Installing the new agent
     ------------------------

4.2.1. Installation process description
       --------------------------------

The installer performs three operations on the target computer :
  1. stop and delete any Cygwin OpenSSH service detected,
  2. copy the Cygwin tree,
  3. configure the client :
    a. generate an OpenSSH key,
    b. set-up and start the OpenSSH service.

If the installer is run using the "/UPDATE" flag, steps 1 and 3 are not
performed.

If the installer found that an agent is already installed at the same
version and the same place, the install is aborted unless the "/FORCE"
flag is specified; this is a foolproof mechanism to prevent looping
installations.

It is recommended to use the "/UPDATE" flag for updates by deployment.


4.2.2. Agent Installation
       ------------------

4.2.2.2. Interactive mode
         ----------------

To install the new agent, the procedure is exactly the same as for
previous versions, namely :
  - Copy the installer (pulse2-secure-agent-2.1.1.exe) on the
    workstation,
  - Copy the public key "id_dsa.pub" or "id_rsa.pub" in the same
    directory as the installer (optional if a "Linbox" agent has
    already been installed on the client),
  - Click on the agent,
  - Follow the instructions keeping the default options.


4.2.2.3. Automated mode
         --------------
The procedure is as follows :
  - Copy the installer (pulse2-secure-agent-2.1.1.exe) on the
    workstation,
  - Copy the public key "id_dsa.pub" or "id_rsa.pub" in the same
    directory as the installer (optional if a "Linbox" agent has
    already been installed on the client),
  - Run the executable from the command line using the argument "/S".

For example, the following .bat file can be used to deploy the agent in
silent mode :

-8<-------8<-------8<-------8<-------8<-------8<-------8<-------8<------
start /wait pulse2-secure-agent-2.1.1.exe /S
-8<-------8<-------8<-------8<-------8<-------8<-------8<-------8<------


4.2.2.4. About /D command line flag
         --------------------------

Installation directory can be specified with /D.
Please always uses double quotes around the path to avoid problems.
For example :
pulse2-secure-agent-2.1.1.exe /S /D="C:\Pulse2\Secure Agent"


4.2.3. Agent Update
       ------------

4.2.3.1. Interactive mode
         ----------------

Follow the installation procedure by running the installer binary with
the following parameter : "/UPDATE".
After the update it is advisable to reboot the workstation as soon as
possible.


4.2.3.2. Automated mode
         --------------

Follow the installation procedure by running the installer binary with
the following parameters : "/S /UPDATE".
After the update it is advisable to reboot the workstation as soon as
possible.


5. Installation check-up
   ---------------------

To ensure the a working OpenSSH service is installed, simply :
  - Check that the "Mandriva OpenSSH Agent" is running,
  - Run directly
    "C:\Program Files\Mandriva\OpenSSH\bin\bash.exe"
    to obtain a bash command line :
    "bash-3.2 $"
  - Initialize the "PATH" environment variable:
-8<-------8<-------8<-------8<-------8<-------8<-------8<-------8<------
bash-3.2 $ export PATH="/bin"
-8<-------8<-------8<-------8<-------8<-------8<-------8<-------8<------
  - Using the command line, check that the "mount" command returns at
    least the following lines :
bash-3.2 $ mount
C:/Program Files/Mandriva/OpenSSH/bin on /usr/bin type ntfs (binary,auto)
C:/Program Files/Mandriva/OpenSSH/lib on /usr/lib type ntfs (binary,auto)
C:/Program Files/Mandriva/OpenSSH on / type ntfs (binary,auto)
C:/Documents and Settings on /home type ntfs (binary,posix=0)
C: on /cygdrive/c type ntfs (binary,posix=0,user,noumount,auto)
-8<-------8<-------8<-------8<-------8<-------8<-------8<-------8<------
  - Finally, check that from the Pulse2 web interface the green light is
  shown the position is available (green LED).
